# Hey, I'm Frikky 
I build things, primarily in Go, Python and Javascript. My focus and specialty is in security, but I dabble in fundraising, fintech, practical AI and a few more obscure areas. Talk to me about automation, AI, startups, blue teaming and mentorship (both ways :cyclone:)

:zap: What I'm doing now :zap:
